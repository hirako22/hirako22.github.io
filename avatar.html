  <h1>The Top 11 Best Avatar: the Last Airbender Episodes</h1>
  
  <p>Avatar: the Last Airbender (henceforth referred to as 'Avatar'; screw James Cameron's unoriginal, already
    dated-looking smurf movie) is, in my opinion, the greated show of all time. This is of course limited to what
  shows I have seen, but this show blows all other shows I've seen away. It is filled with
    beautiful stories, in-depth messages, unforgettable characters, amazing visuals, enlightening philosophy,
    and sparkling emotion, all against a backdrop of a whirlwind plot with amazing world building. The reason I have
  selected 11 as a number is for the same reason I selected 11 as my movie number; not mentioning any of these episodes
  would be a crime, and 11 is a nice number. Simplistic characters, prime, whatever.</p>
  
  <center><h3>11.  The Storm</h3></center>
  <img src="storm.jpeg">
  
  <p>The first couple of episodes of Avatar were wonderful in their own right, but it just seemed like another skillful
  kids' show. Then "the Winter Solstice" episodes happened, and we all could tell we were in for a truly fun ride. There
  was actual palpable, adult pressure. Aang has work to do. The fire nation is already moving fast, and a day approaches
  when they will be unstoppable. There is no one else who can do this. Into the warzone we go.</p>
  <p>We knew we had an adventure on our hands, and, given the scenery and creativity of bending, it was going to be both
  interesting and fun. However, we didn't know just how powerful the storytelling was going to get, nor how deep the
  characters were, nor how many emotions were about to come thrashing out of the flood gates until this episode.</p>
  <p>Almost nothing happens in this episode. A storm comes, Sokka and a fisherman are threatened, Aang saves them. Zuko's
  crew is threatened, and Zuko eventually lets them rest after leading them to safety. But this episode tells us all we
  need to know, and suggests a bit more. In alternating campfire scenes, we learn the backstories of Aang and Zuko. Aang
  learns he is the Avatar, and we feel the full pressure on him. Two of his mentors fight about how to raise him. The monk
  closest to him doesn't want to rob him of his childhood. The other sees clouds forming from the fire nation, and takes
  the utilitarian position; the world needs the avatar now, and the sacrifice of a boy's humanity is a necessary toll to
  keep the world in balance. Aang overhears this, and runs away. When he wakes up, the world is on the brink of shambles.
  We understand that, hidden behind his childlike whimsy lies a tremendous guilt.</p>
  <p>Zuko is a young prince, ready to make his father proud. In a demonstration of something not quite evil, he is punished
  by his ruthless and power-hungry father. Because of this, we see again a display of Zuko's not-so-evil principles, and he
  is banished, and here we are. We understand that Zuko bottles his conflicting shame and messed-up familial relationships
  into catching the avatar, and we wonder if Zuko is truly bad.</p>
  <p>The storm in the episode is clearly a metaphor for the coming storm in the world of avatar. While Aang turned his back
  on the world before, he is not turning back any more, and will save those in need from now on. Zuko learns to put away
  his inner demons (for a moment at least) and does what is right for the people around him. It would have been fine to
  just introduce the backstories of the characters separately; one would get the same depth regardless. But this makers of
  this show understand that some of the best villains are the ones most similar to the protagonists, giving a backstory
  yin and yang, itself in line with the show's many Daoist themes.</p>
  <p>I think it is probably true that this is the episode when people realize that Avatar isn't simply another show. It
  is when people realize that the makers of this show, once they prove the concept to the executives, are going to take
  this show as deep as they want with an enormous amount of skill.</p>
  
  <center><h3>10.  Tales of Ba Sing Se</h3></center>
  <img src="tales.jpg">
  
  <p>Here is another episode in which nothing happens. We simply observe everyday events, and appreciate simplicity, a
  key principle of Daoism. It is almost a form of meditation where we simply sit with the characters we have come to know
  and love. Toph and Katara, two differing characters who have hit heads in the past improve on their relationship. 
    (not that this lasted more than an episode, thank goodness. Aren't bickering main characters just the <i>worst</i>?)Toph
  shows a vulnerable side, making us love her even more, and, for a cherry on top, mean girls get what's coming to them.</p>
  <p>Iroh's story speaks for itself. If you haven't seen this episode, watch the entire show, but also suffice it to say
  that the number one instance where people cry during this show is during Iroh's story.</p>
  <p>In The Tale of Aang, he makes a zoo, freeing animals from the dismal original zoo. Appa is still missing in this
  episode, and through this tale we still feel Aang's yearning for his oldest surviving friend. The danger of the whole
    Appa debacle was that Aang would be back to normal after an episode of his mourning. The creators wisely stray away
    from this; they have too much respect for themselves and the audience. This adds more realism and heartache in an
    already heartbreaking season. In my calculation, 13/20 episodes in this season end on sad notes. That's just plain
    badass, especially for a kids' show. I recall, when I was a kid, associating this show with a merciless but 
    irresistible sadness that challenged me in ways I had never been challenged before. But I digress. The imagery of 
    Aang and the voice acting is to be commended. It takes a good actor to be a good actor, but a great actor to be a
  bad actor. By which I mean we can hear Aang trying to sound happy, but hints of deep loss leak through.</p>
  <p>Sokka is Zulu for "lover boy." How fitting for him to stumble into a girls' group of poetry, and it is a testament
  to the creativity of the writers to have a haiku battle take place. In usual (but nowhere near constant) Sokka fashion,
  his story provides relaxation from the intense emotions in the rest of the characters.</p>
  <p>We rarely see Zuko's humanity, and even less so him being a normal teenage boy. In his tale, he goes out on a date.
  He is reluctant at first, as the many hardships he's faced have made his shell very thick. Here we also see one of the
  first instances of firebending being portrayed in a good light. The culture of fire is still protrayed by the show to
  be a part of this world, and not just a menace. The forms, dances, culture, and fashion of the fire nation are given 
    proper respect; there
  is no "the bad guys are evil and ugly" simplifying here, as opposed to stories like The Lord of the Rings. Zuko here
  learns to let go of his shame. Granted, this is the shame of being a firebender and not being banished and labeled a
  national disgrace by all he held dear, but it is invigorating to see Zuko come out of his shell just once. Around this
  time, we come to like Zuko quite a bit for a villain.</p>
  <p>In The Tale of Momo, we get a story without words, but emotion is still present. We are shown that Appa's disappearance
  has affected the entire group, and that Aang has just been the focus. In typical Avatar fashion, we end on a sad note;
  however, we also a "wait a second!" moment: the last shot is of Momo cuddling himself inside Appa's footprint, alone, 
    reminding
  us of Appa's absence. The sky is dark, and it is raining a melancholy rain. But Wait A Second! Appa was here!</p>
  
  <center><h3>9.  Sozin's Comet (parts 1, 2, 3, and 4)</h3></center>
  <img src="sozin.png">
  
  <p>The series finale did not disappoint, which is high praise for a show as amazing as Avatar. I once heard that there
  are two species of storytellers: the planters and the architects. The planters plant interesting ideas and watch where
  they go. Architects design everything going into place. The makers of Avatar are architects, and they have made the
  most amazing, well put-together structure. All of the characters come together for the final battle. We are treated to
    the perfect final matchups, a wonderful score (example: <a target="_blank" 
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFnnNijn_OI">"the Last Agni Kai"</a>), animation more intense than the 
    other episodes, and action at the
  maximum. The scenery is of a red sky. Fire is everywhere. The apocalypse is here. The air is thick with desperation and 
    anxiety, but the bravery of our heroes is felt more strongly. I have included all four parts as a cheat to fit in
  more episodes. Four is an unusual number for a final showdown, but where there are four elements, there are four final
    parts to the last chapter and, with writing prowess such as this, nothing feels disjoint.</p>
  <p>What makes this such a
  brilliant finale, however, is the true ambiguity of the outcome. This is an extremely difficult thing to accomplish,
  near impossible for a kids' show. With heroes as lovable as these, and villains so lovably evil, the good guys have to
  beat the bad guys. This is assured. But what is not assured is this: Will Aang kill the bad guy? Embedded and explored
  in this question are the morals of taking another person's life, doing what everyone says to do (and, as the show makes
    clear, what probably <i>has</i> to be done) when you don't think it is right, the question of indoctrination. This is
  such a challenging moral question that humanity still hasn't solved it. It is so gutsy for the creators to put this
  question in the finale, and makes us genuinely wonder how it will end. As as for the scene with Iroh and Zuko... suffice
  it to say that this scene comes second as to the crying from the audience.</p>
  <p>Most top ten Avatar episodes I've seen rank this episode as the greatest. The reason it is not for me is that it
  signifies the end of the series, and makes me feel sad, and not in the masochistic way of wanting more that is so often
    seen from Avatar.</p>
  
  <center><h3>8.  The Chase</h3></center>
  <img src="chase.jpg">
  
  <p>Good chase sequences have nonstop action and convoluted structure. Great chase sequences put you as close as possible
  to the characters you empathize with. Avatar shows you what the chase does to the characters. There are times in Mad Max:
  Fury Road where I wonder "don't these people ever get thirsty or tired?" In Avatar, the characters do. This episode pushes
  our heros right up to their limits. This chase is nonstop, the point of the episode. It shows us how ruthless Azula really
  is. It is convoluted; Zuko and Iroh on one side, the gaang on another, and Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee on a third side.
   Relationships are strained, strength is waned, and the characters separate and are rearranged in unexpected ways. The
  conversation over tea with Toph and Iroh is one of the show's true treasures. I cannot think of another instance in any
  story when a minor villain and a minor hero have a pleasant conversation. The climax does not diappoint. How amazing is
  a fight where Azula fights Aang, Zuko fights Azula, and Aang fights Zuko? At the end, we get, in typical Avatar fashion,
  an unsatisfactory ending; Azula escapes and Iroh is seriously injured. But the final scene is, in typical Avatar fashion,
  perfect. Our heros take a long-needed sleep. The thing that sets this nonstop action sequence apart is that it is
  exciting and complex (yet easy to follow) by itself, but its effect on the characters is equally interesting.</p>
