  <h1>The Top 11 Best Avatar: the Last Airbender Episodes</h1>
  
  <p>Avatar: the Last Airbender (henceforth referred to as 'Avatar'; screw James Cameron's unoriginal, already
    dated-looking smurf movie) is, in my opinion, the greated show of all time. This is of course limited to what
  shows I have seen, but this show blows all other shows I've seen away. It is filled with
    beautiful stories, in-depth messages, unforgettable characters, amazing visuals, enlightening philosophy,
    and sparkling emotion, all against a backdrop of a whirlwind plot with amazing world building. The reason I have
  selected 11 as a number is for the same reason I selected 11 as my movie number; not mentioning any of these episodes
  would be a crime, and 11 is a nice number. Simplistic characters, prime, whatever.</p>
  
  <center><h3>The Storm</h3></center>
  <img src="storm.jpeg">
  
  <p>The first couple of episodes of Avatar were wonderful in their own right, but it just seemed like another skillful
  kids' show. Then "the Winter Solstice" episodes happened, and we all could tell we were in for a truly fun ride. There
  was actual palpable, adult pressure. Aang has work to do. The fire nation is already moving fast, and a day approaches
  when they will be unstoppable. There is no one else who can do this. Into the warzone we go.</p>
  <p>We knew we had an adventure on our hands, and, given the scenery and creativity of bending, it was going to be both
  interesting and fun. However, we didn't know just how powerful the storytelling was going to get, nor how deep the
  characters were, nor how many emotions were about to come thrashing out of the flood gates until this episode.</p>
  <p>Almost nothing happens in this episode. A storm comes, Sokka and a fisherman are threatened, Aang saves them. Zuko's
  crew is threatened, and Zuko eventually lets them rest after leading them to safety. But this episode tells us all we
  need to know, and suggests a bit more. In alternating campfire scenes, we learn the backstories of Aang and Zuko. Aang
  learns he is the Avatar, and we feel the full pressure on him. Two of his mentors fight about how to raise him. The monk
  closest to him doesn't want to rob him of his childhood. The other sees clouds forming from the fire nation, and takes
  the utilitarian position; the world needs the avatar now, and the sacrifice of a boy's childhood is a necessary toll to
  keep the world in balance. Aang overhears this, and runs away. When we wakes up, the world is on the brink of shambles.
  We understand that, hidden behind his childlike whimsy lies a tremendous guilt.</p>
  <p>Zuko is a young prince, ready to make his father proud. In a demonstration of something not quite evil, he is punished
  by his ruthless and power-hungry father. Because of this, we see again a display of Zuko's not so evil principles, and he
  is banished, and here we are. We understand that Zuko bottles his conflicting shame and messed-up familial relationships
  into catching the avatar, and we wonder if Zuko is truly bad.</p>
  <p>The storm in the episode is clearly a metaphor for the coming storm in the world of avatar. While Aang turned his back
  on the world before, he is not turning back any more, and will save those in need from now on. Zuko learns to put away
  his inner demons (for a moment at least) and does what is right for the people around him. It would have been fine to
  just introduce the backstories of the characters separately; one would get the same depth regardless. But this makers of
  this show understand that some of the best villains are the ones most similar to the protagonists, giving a backstory
  yin and yang, itself in line with the show's many Daoist themes.</p>
  <p>I think it is probably true that this is the episode when people realize that Avatar isn't simply another show. It
  is when people realize that the makers of this show, once they prove the concept to the executives, are going to take
  this show as deep as they want with an enormous amount of skill.</p>
