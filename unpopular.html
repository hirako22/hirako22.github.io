  <h3>Sasquatch Mountain (Devil on the Mountain)</h3>
    <p>Sasquatch Mountain is by no means a perfect movie, but I find it extremely not bad, with
  many really quite good ideas. I first saw it when it premiered on TV(!) in 2006, and was mesmerized by the atmosphere.
  It stayed in my memory for many years until reseeing it a bunch of times in 2019. I highly encourage anyone to check
  it out; everyone who writes about this movie says it is complete trash, but I find the plot, (some) performances, 
    characters, and atmosphere pretty darn respectable, especially given its meager budget.</p>
    <br>
  <h3>Paul Blart: Mall Cop</h3>
  <p>I am very surprised no one seems to like this movie. When I first saw it I found it very
    exciting. Kevin James gives a great performance. The villain is annoying, but in a way where you root for the hero
    even more, instead of getting tired of the movie. The plot is dumb, but anyone who takes this movie that seriously
    in that kind of way is a total snob. The strength of the movie, for me, is Kevin James' character, and transforming
    the mundane setting of a mall into an action center. The movie plays to a young kid's fantasies of the crushingly
    boring suburbs becoming a place to be leapt over and used in action.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</h3>
    <p>I know, I know. Midichlorians. Jar-Jar. Little Anakin. But here's a thought. What's the
    <i>real</i> reason we go to see a Star Wars movie? It's to see incredible things, like starting out on a spaceship,
    taking a detour to the planet below, taking a detour to a pond in a remote forest on that planet, finding a
    frickin' underwater city(!), an underwater adventure through the cavernous core of the planet (seriously, how is
    this the only sci-fi movie where we go underwater? It's Jaws on steroids, but one can have infinitely more 
    frightening creatures appear than sharks), podracing, and a dope battle, where it includes an army of droids and an army
    of aliens with strange alien weapons this
    time. Also, Darth Maul is one of the best characters in the Star Wars universe. Ray Park rules!</p> 
    <p>I also enjoy the ethereal feel and quiet moments of this movie. This is the first movie that tells
    the story of how the universe got to Luke Skywalker's universe. It carries its own mythos.</p><p>As for Jar-Jar,
    when I was a kid, I liked him. I appreciate Lucas taking risks, and we see less of him as the series goes on, 
    correcting for his mistakes. Lucas understands that the main focus of a Star Wars movie should be the creativity
    of the universe created, and this is what he focuses on.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</h3>
    <p>I know, I know. The dialogue. But here's a thought. What's the
    <i>real</i> reason we go to see a Star Wars movie? It's to see incredible things, like starting out with a bang,
    an alien assassination attempt truly creepy and assassin-y, a 3-way chase through an AMAZING city at night, during
    which Obi-wan just hangs on with his hands on a small droid, a tense moment at an alien bar, the fantastic imagery
    of Kamino, an actual tusken camp, a fantastic sequence in a droid factory where the factory gets involved (honestly,
    how novel is that? For once we actually see the world in which sci-fi gizmos are created), the Roman colliseum
    Star Wars-ified, the amazing battles that follow, and the lightsaber climax. Yoda isn't a puppet anymore. Yes, the
    dialogue is terrible, but it's a small price to pay for the real reasons one goes to see a Star Wars movie. This
    movies is one fantastic, world-exploring sequence after another. Note: I also really like Revenge of the Sith, but
    a lot of other people do too, so it does not fit this description.</p>
  <p>Also, I'm just gonna leave this here: Star Wars: the Clone Wars has one of the greatest 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1sM9tjqSa8">battle</a> sequences I have
  ever seen. If the rest of the movie were a bit better, I would put that movie on here, but
  a miraculous and genius action sequence doesn't make a movie. But man, that is SO GOOD! No wonder, the movie
  was directed by Dave Filoni, who directed the amazing action sequence that is The Blue Spirit in Avatar: the Last
  Airbender.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I</h3>
  <p>A lot of people found this movie too slow. I certainly don't enjoy when main characters bicker and fight. But I'm a
   huge sucker for atmosphere, and this movie has a great sense of paranoia all the way through it. The thought of being
  hunted by fearsome magicians and not being able to stay in any one town too long is immensely exciting. I also appreciate
  how they walk everywhere. It's a bit reminiscent of the excitement the gaang in Avatar: the Last Airbender experiences
  when they are in enemy territory, except here it's more intense because they're on foot. Also, Godric's Hollow looks a
  lot like my hometown in Wisconsin, so that is another way this movie's atmosphere resonates with me. Also, there really
  is no objection to any technical points of the movie; just the slowness, which makes sense when you're on foot, constantly
  on the alert. When you're paranoid, time goes by slowly. I maybe would prefer it if the movie just allowed me to savor
  the excitement just a little longer.</p>
