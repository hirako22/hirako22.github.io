  <p>Here are some mathematical ramblings I just decided to throw up here. Some
    of these documents will be problems I have done to further my understanding, and others will be notes I've
    taken to manifest Feynman's adage that one does not understand something until they can explain it to
    someone else (although in math this is less true than in physics, in my opinion). I have posted them here
    so I have an actual repository, and if by some miracle someone finds both them and them useful. 
  </p>

  <h3>Some beautiful problems</h3>
  <p>At least one of these problems has stronger results, but I'll only ever include problems here on which
    I get full points.
    <a target="_blank" href="lateX/problems.pdf">problems</a>, <a target="_blank" href="lateX/solutions.pdf">solutions</a>. 
    These problems span number theory to equations on manifolds to string theory. Those who
  wrote the problems are credited in the file.</p>
  
  <h3>Algebraic Topology</h3>
  <p>Some algebraic topology <a target="_blank" href="lateX/algtop.pdf">problems</a>.</p> 
  
  <h3>Higher Algebraic Topology</h3>
  <p> Here's some more advanced <a target="_blank" href="lateX/bundle_theory.pdf">stuff</a> involving fiber bundles, 
    higher homotopy groups, etc.</p>
  
  <h3>Some cool differential geometry problems</h3>
  <p>I took a course in differential geometry, and have some problems solved
    <a target="_blank" href="lateX/dq.pdf">here</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Differential Topology</h3>
  <p>For some reason I have trouble remembering pretty basic proofs in differential geometry, so I've kept a stash of 
    <a target="_blank" href="lateX/diftop.pdf">differential topology</a> problems.</p>
  
  <h3>Symplectic Geometry and Geometric Topology</h3>
  <p>These are <a target="_blank" href="lateX/symnotes.pdf">notes</a> for a presentation I gave for a course on symplectic 
    geometry, on the connection between surgery theory and lagrangian immersions.</p>
  
  <h3>Quantum Groups</h3>
  <p>Here's a heavy item. These are 
    <a target="_blank" href="lateX/Quantum_Groups.pdf">notes</a> 
     taken during Prof. Daniel Bump's course on quantum groups. What is NOT in here is a precise 
    definition of a quantum
    group, because one does not exist. What is in here are standard introductions to quantum algebra 
    (enveloping algebras, quantum trace, bialgebras,
    hopf algebras), monoidal, framed, and braided categories, quasitriangularity of Hopf algebras, connections to
    low-dimensional topology, some examples of what are classified as "quantum groups," as well as some interesting
    properties of these, and vertex models.</p>
  
  <h3>Mirror Symmetry</h3>
  <p>In the winter of 2020, I did a directed reading program on mirror symmetry under the supervision of 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~lt691/">Libby Taylor</a>,
  and here are my <a target="_blank" href="lateX/mirrorsymmetry.pdf">notes</a> before the coronavirus pandemic caused 
    all sorts of chaos. I intend to finish these notes/expand on the subject more at some point.</p>
  
  <h3>Quantum field theory notes/problems</h3>
  <p>By 'mathematical quantum field theory,' I mean examining quantum field-theoretic concepts through a mathematically
    rigorous lense.
    These are problems given by Prof. Sourav Chatterjee's seminar on mathematical physics, who, the first day
    of class, called it 'Quantum field theory for mathematicians,' as well as some supplementary problems in textbooks, which
    are not mathematically rigorous. Because I was an undergrad in his seminar, I had to do some
    note-taking and these problems. 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~souravc/qft-lectures-combined.pdf">
    Here</a> are the notes and <a target="_blank" href="lateX/273.pdf">here</a> are the problems.</p>
  
  <h3>Analytic number theory problems</h3>
  <p>Analytic number theory scares me. So I decided to put some guts into it and do some 
    <a target="_blank" href="lateX/analytic.pdf">problems</a> written by Prof. Kannan
    Soundarajan and Prof. Andrew Granville in their book on multiplicative number theory.</p>
  
  <h3>Topological quantum computation literature review</h3>
  <p>In the Winter of 2019, I took Prof. Tsachy Weissman's EE376A: Information Theory. This was my final 
    <a target="_blank" href="lateX/EE376A.pdf">report</a> in which I went overboard.</p>
  
  <h3>My favorite algorithms</h3>
  <p>Like, according to Lau's conjecture, almost all math people, I've been getting pulled more and more into 
  theoretical computer science. <a target="_blank" href="lateX/algorithms.pdf">Here</a> is a list of my 
    favorite algorithms.</p>
  
  <br>
   <h3>Mathematical preliminary objects, the precise definitions of which I keep forgetting.</h3>
  <p>Here is an <a target="_blank" href="lateX/terms.pdf">appendix</a>. Here is a list of my favorite theorems, whose
  proofs I want to remember.</p>
