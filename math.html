  <p>Here are some mathematical ramblings I just decided to throw up here. Some
    of these documents will be problems I have done to further my understanding, and others will be notes I've
    taken to manifest Feynman's adage that one does not understand something until they can explain it to
    someone else (although in math this is less true than in physics, in my opinion). I have posted them here
    so I have an actual repository, and if by some miracle someone finds both them and them useful.

  <h3>Some beautiful problems</h3>
  <p>Over the course of my college career, I have run into some pretty amazing ideas. Here I have recorded some problems
  that I've been given that are amazing in their daunting-ness and simplicity, profoundness, and/or beauty.
  problems, solutions. These problems span number theory to wave equations on manifolds to string theory. Those who
  wrote the problems are credited in the file.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>My favorite algorithms</h3>
  <p>Like, according to Lau's conjecture, almost all mathematicians, I've been getting pulled more and more into 
  theoretical computer science. -Here- is a list of my favorite algorithms.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Mathematical preliminary objects, the precise definitions of which I keep forgetting.</h3>
  <p>When reading papers or starting a subject in graduate-level math, I find myself forgetting exact definitions
    and intuitions. I have thuse compiled an <a target="_blank" href="terms.pdf">appendix</a>. So far (I see this list growing) I have basic abstract algebraic
  objects, topology and manifolds, and differential forms done with field theory in mind.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Some cool differential geometry problems</h3>
  <p>Prof. Jonathan Luk is awesome! I took his differential geometry course, and have some of his problems solved
    <a target="_blank" href="dq.pdf">here</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Topological quantum computation literature review</h3>
  <p>In the Winter of 2019, I took Prof. Tsachy Weissman's EE376A: Information Theory. This was my final 
    <a target="_blank" href="EE376A.pdf">report</a>, and went a bit overboard.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Quantum Groups</h3>
  <p>Here's a heavy item. The above alludes to quantum groups, notes of which are given 
    <a target="_blank" href="Quantum_Groups.pdf">here</a>. 
    These are notes taken during Prof. Daniel Bump's course on quantum groups. What is NOT in here is a precise 
    definition of a quantum
    group, because one does not exist. What is in here are standard introductions to quantum algebra (bialgebras and
    hopf algebras), monoidal, framed, and braided categories, quasitriangularity of Hopf algebras, connections to
    low-dimensional topology, some examples of what are classified as "quantum groups," as well as some interesting
    properties of these, and vertex models.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Lie Algebras</h3>
  <p>There's lots of connections to quantum groups and operator algebras of conformal field theories. Unfortunately,
    Lie Theory is a super dense subject. <a target="_blank" href="lie.pdf">Here</a> is my attempt to understand it. 
    This is a prerequisite to one of the
    algorithms in my "favorite algorithms" file. Because of the scope of Lie algebra, these notes will be in progress
    for quite some time.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Analytic number theory problems</h3>
  <p>Analytic number theory scares me. So I decided to put some guts into it and do some problems written by Prof. Kannan
    Soundarajan and Prof. Andrew Granville in their book on multiplicative number theory.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Some mathematical quantum field theory</h3>
  <p>By 'mathematical quantum field theory,' I mean mathematically rigorous quantum field theory calculations. (Path
    integral, I'm looking at you)
    These are problems given by Prof. Sourav Chatterjee's seminar on mathematical physics, which, the first day
    of class, called it 'Quantum field theory for mathematicians.' Because I was an undergrad, I had to do some
    note-taking and these problems. 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~souravc/qft-lectures-combined.pdf">
    Here</a> are the notes and <a target="_blank" href="273.pdf">here</a> are the problems.</p>
