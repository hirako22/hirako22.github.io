  <h2>Huh. The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is on Alec's list</h2>
  
  <p>This is the only movie on my list that I don't think is objectively as good as the others. Many people have problems with
    it, and even a few I respect. One of the main criticisms is that Andrew Garfield doesn't make a good spider-man. Tobey Maguire
    was way more awkward and nerdy than skateboard-riding prettyboy. There is the classic argument that Garfield played the 
    wisecracking webslinger better, which I shan't develop on. I also might add that I found the skateboarding of Garfield an
    interesting twist on Peter Parker. If you remain unconvinced that I genuinely thought this and am just making excuses as to why
    I must defend Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Marc Webb, three of my favorite actors/directors, I sympathize. However, this 
    was my first Webb movie, and this movie <i>made</i> Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone two of my favorite actors. Furthermore, I
    am loyal first and foremost to the spider-man comics. I used to read them every Sunday, and I pored over the spider-man 
    encyclopedia countless times as a child. Another argument against this movie
    is that the Lizard is a lame villain. Sure, it's a bit lackluster, but the focus is on spider-man; it's why the villain shows up
    so late in the movie. These two points lead me to why I enjoy the movie so damn much.</p>
  <p>
  
  
  <h2>Why I didn't like Sal&ograve;, or the 120 Days of Sodom (how to do disturbing well)</h2>
  
  <p>It's not because I was offended by the disturbing imagery. I watched the infamous Sal&ograve;, or the 120 Days of Sodom
    (1975) last night, and while I didn't hate the movie, as the screen went black I felt completely empty; I didn't get
    anything out of it. What I liked was the artfulness of the shots, in an Anderson-esque composition, as well as the dancing
    while the prostitutes told their stories. It didn't feel like a geek show, that Pasolini was trying to pull a fast one on
    me. That's about it.</p>
  <p>I'm probably in the minority here. Michael Haneke and Gaspar No&eacute; both adore the movie, and it's in the Criterion
    Collection, which has movies that I usually like. I have read online that it is a statement about fascism and society. I'll
    tackle this case first.</p>
  <p>What exactly is the statement about fascism here? That evil men use fascism to commit unspeakable atrocities toward innocent
    people? This is not a groundbreaking artistic statement. That this is not a groundbreaking artistic statement is not the reason
    it was bad, but here a filmmaker has a choice: either explore the effect this has on characters or include more symbolism.
    Pasolini does neither. There is no attempt at characterization. I was just watching people as stiff as chess pieces
    doing horrible things. There was no character development in the torturers or the tortured. One doesn't have to do this,
    but they must find some other way to engage the audience. Pasolini didn't, or, if he did, he didn't do it for me. It felt
    like I was just watching things happen onscreen; a two-dimensional experience of moving bodies. Maybe this stoicism is an 
    artistic statement; that the filmmaker doesn't care about what's happening to these poor men and women, showing the cold
    passiveness involved with this sort of treachery. In this case, the way to make it work is to show the victims' emotions more,
    because it makes the lack of caring from the filmmaker evident. This didn't happen. What about including more symbolism?
    As far as I know, the movie doesn't  make any conclusions. It doesn't teach me anything. If this is a metaphor for
    fascism, the message is restricted to "evil men use fascism to molest the public." I read somewhere that Pasolini claimed that
    the coprophagia was a metaphor for junk food culture. If this is true, the metaphor was lousily executed. This also begs the
    question of why Pasolini was using such extreme a metaphor? If one uses an extreme metaphor, it should be because they are
    wildly passionate about the material, but that wasn't the vibe I was getting watching this movie. In this case, the cold
    way in which he shot things works against the claim. If Sal&ograve; is a metaphor for fascism, it is a blunt one.</p>
  <p>If this isn't supposed to be a metaphor at all for fascism, I think the movie is considerably more sophisticated as a pure
    portrait of hell. I've seen portraits of hell that, in my opinion, are much better and more engaging, but this is a fine spin
    on it. If this is the case, I think it's more true to Marqui de Sade's original work; it's a chronicle of human debauchery
    that one should to visit if one wants to visit. If this is the case, however, the cold, dispassionate way in which it is shot
    works against it was well. Would it not be more hellish if the filmmaker showed joy with this material? Instead, the austerity
    diffuses the hellishness, and leaves me, again, feeling like I wasted my time with this movie.</p>
  <p>In short, I think if Pasolini tried to use this as symbolism, it is as sophisticated as any high schooler's short story. There
    are no conclusions or clever ways in which the metaphor is used. If not, it is a lackluster exercise in horrible images. I think
    there are many more disturbing movies that use it's disturbing-ness, rather than have it be the entire movie. I'm pretty sure
    this is the most disturbing movie I've seen, but now I'll compare it to disturbing movies that I think are better.<p>
  <p>Last House on the Left (1972) is better because it is up front about how it's trying to be disturbing; the filmmakers are
    honest about how they want to disturb and disgust. They show a geek show, but want you to know they want a geek show, because
    they are frustrated about Vietnam. One can feel the passion in their metaphor, and I left the movie feeling like I just had an
    experience. I felt no passion in Pasolini's movie, and left the movie accordingly.</p>
  <p>That's the thing about most respectable disturbing movies. There's often passion. What about disturbing movies devoid of
    passion?</p>
  <p>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) appears like it might be a geek show, but the artistry of the cinematography, set design,
    writing, and especially acting hint to use that we clearly are dealing this an artist. Furthermore, the awfulness in that movie
    feels like it is just a consequence of the plot. Everything in that movie is logical, and it is more based in fact than
    Sal&ograve;. Furthermore, it is comedic, a satire on the American family in the seventies. The upheaval of the sixties and the
    phenomenon of serial killers during this era is reflected in this movie much more than the fascism of Italy is reflected in
    Sal&ograve;.</p>
  <p>Another movie without passion is Ichi the Killer (2001). Here the movie is psychotically enthralled with how crazy it is. It
    completely surrenders itself to its mayhem and madness, and occupies a piece of filmspace where a viewer goes to if they want to
    lose their mind and have fun doing it. It makes no attempt to make moral statements; it tries actively to illustrate how fun it
    is to be morally reprehensible, if you're crazy.</p>
  <p>However, all of these movies deal with their disturbing-ness in their own unique way. Sal&ograve; certainly shouldn't lose 
    points for going in a different direction than these movies. However, there is another disturbing movie about evil men using 
    fascism to torment and control innocent children: Battle Royale (2000). Here I argue that this movie is, in many ways, a few
    orders of magnitude better than Sal&ograve;. First of all, Battle Royale is similarly blunt in its metaphor. It doesn't contain
    more symbolism than Sal&ograve;. However, it is infinitely more engaging. The movie is about being an adolescent in a world where
    the adults are insane and evil. More broadly, it is about the common person in a world where the rulers are insane and evil. Because
    of this theme,
    Battle Royale develops heavily on the perpetrator, Kitano, and the victims. In most of the scenes with the victims, the shots are
    cold and austere; most of the children getting slaughtered have no background to us. However, the children are allowed to show
    their emotions. They kick, scream, run, and cry, while the camera looks passively onward. This gets across the message of adults'
    stoicism, but is all the more effective when this emotion is shown. Furthermore, the extreme violence has a purpose. Adolescence
    is an intense time, and the backdrop of gruesome violence serves to make those intense aspects of being an adolescent all the more
    intense. The violence is extreme <i>because it allows for the purest examination</i> of what it means to be an adolescent being
    taken advantage of by those in power. Battle Royale also engages with protagonists, albeit in a minimalist way. By doing this, it
    forces us to feel the frustration they feel, and the frustration the director feels, leading me to my next point. The violence in 
    Battle Royale is more truthful than in Sal&ograve;. Kinji Fukusaku wanted to direct Battle Royale because he essentially lived
    through Battle Royale. Pasolini didn't live through anything like Sal&ograve;. This is not to say that he shouldn't have directed
    it, but it does explain why the message, if it exists, is really weak. Both movies give cold, hellish depictions of extreme 
    violence committed by evil men of power against innocent adolescents. But Battle Royale finds a way to be much more engaging, 
    is reflective of the powerless human's condition, is a warning and a fable. It is disturbing because being disturbing is the most
    effective and passionate way to tell the story. In Sal&ograve;, the disturbing-ness is just there, as thematically deep as an 
    Aristocrats Joke. It isn't offensive, I'll give it that, but it just sits there.
    To all the respectable filmmakers who love Sal&ograve;, I ask: Why, and have you seen Battle Royale?</p>
  <p><b>Update:</b> Upon further reading, it appears Pasolini wanted to adapt Marquis de Sade's work, and then decided to apply it to
    fascist Italy. This emphasizes my point: Pasolini wanted to adapt the content and subsequently ascribed meaning (not well-executed,
    as it felt like exactly that), whereas Fukusaku knew he could use Battle Royale for a message we wanted to give us.</p>
  
  <h2>Why I don't like Romance in Movies</h2>
  
  <p>I just finished watching Like Water for Chocolate (1992), and, while I thought it was a good movie, it wasn't
    my cup of tea, or rather pozole. The movie reminded me of why I find most movies very lacking in terms of romance,
    although this isn't the movie's fault. Rather, the premise of this Romeo and Juliet story is my problem with romance
    movies in general. The premise: Pedro and Tita make eye contact a few times, and then profess their love for each other.
    Their undying love for each other fuels all of the events in the movie. Except wait a minute; why are they so
    in love with each other? The only reasoning the movie seems to give is that they are the most attractive characters. 
    I acknowledge that this doesn't matter, that the correct thing to do is say "but okay, they love each other," that it
    wouldn't be practical for them to know each other given the cartoonishly evil Mama Elena. But I think this highlights
    the flaws in less capricious, more pretentious movies.</p>
  <p>I admit, I used to think my aversion to watching romance on the big screen is just some residual immaturity from my
    days as a sweaty, cars-and-trucks-loving, blow-something-up young boy. The few romances I had seen in movies for most
    of my childhood consisted of: Anakin and Padme, Bella and Edward, the two leads in Top Gun, so uninteresting and
    unmemorable that I can't recall their names, Aang and Katara, Neo and Trinity, and that's all I can remember. Their 
    weakness must have been why I have a pavlovian cringe and/or roll my eyes whenever a romance is shown on screen, right? Except
    I still find almost every movie romance I watch pretty disengaging. The above romances are pretty understandable; what
    about movies where the relationship is the focus, and the characters are n>0-dimensional? All the ones I've seen
    still take on the following form: they meet, and they're in love. But this is not actually love - it's lust. I 
    sympathize; it's tough to form a romance in a non-instant way when you've got other stuff going on. That's fine, but 
    don't try to shove the message that 'they have undying love for each other' down my throat. For almost every movie 
    romance, the movie resorts to a 'love at first sight' excuse for giving us the premise that the two characters are in 
    love, even if the movie is about them being in love! Can't we evolve past this lazy development? Even Shakespeare, in
    Romeo and Juliet, had Romeo 'fall in love' with another character, before switching it up with Juliet around
    fifteen minutes later. He further made fun of this in A Midsummer Nights' Dream.</p>
  <p>Notice I used the word 'almost.' I now list the movie romances I had no problem with, for various reasons. The first is
    this: it's okay to be lazy with the premise of a romance, if they movie isn't about said romance. A good example is 
    Mulholland Drive (2001). A lot of this plot hinges on the romance, but the movie makes clear that a) this is lust,
    and b) it doesn't even matter. What about romances where the whole movie is about developing said romance? The few I 
    don't have a
    problem with are Annie Hall (1977), Heartthrob (2017), (500) Days of Summer (1977),
     The Amazing Spider-Man (I & II) (2012/2014), and Roman Holiday (1977). Let's take them one by one.</p>
  <p>Annie Hall doesn't try to convince us at all that they have undying love for each other. We see the relationship
    start slowly. They like the way the other person looks (in most other movies this would be enough). They share the same
    interests and are interested in what the other person does. Then it falls apart, but we get to know the characters and
    find that, yes, they are pretty compatible, and yes, it makes sense they would care about one another. However, the 
    movie ends up acknowledging that this wasn't love, they were just very fond of each other, and still are. By making their
    relationship this realistic makes us all the more invested in these two peoples' relationship.</p>
  <p>Heartthrob isn't about love, although the characters think they are in love with each other. The entire movie is
    a tragedy surrounding this misconception. When one side believes they're in love with the other, it is because of 
    mental illness: obsessiveness coupled with a toxic relationship with a domineering parent. As for the other side, they
    mistake promiscuity as self-worth due to an event that often results in this behavior, and the misconception that a 
    partner seeing through this means they are truly loved; in other words, trauma and connection issues. Throw in typical
    emotions in a teen and one has a recipe for mistaking strong anger, frustration, depression, etc. for love. This is an
    interesting idea, except why do we get invested in it? For one, the characters are relatable and the dialogue is startlingly
    realistic. Second, we can see how their personalities are compatible, and thirdly, we want to distract ourselves from
    the clouds on the horizon. We care about the relationship because we care about the characters, not because they're in
    'love,' because we know they aren't but wish they are.</p>
  <p>(500) Days of Summer, has a similar approach to a relationship as Annie Hall. In fact, this movie has an
    Altmanesque anti-romance feel to it. It takes the traditional movie romance, makes its characters actually resemble 
    people who could have an undying love for each other, and then points out the absurdity and selfishness involved with
    this type of thinking. Thus this movie isn't about love, it's about romance, and how we can mistake romance for love,
    and how art often does the same thing. We care about the romance because we see Joseph Gordon-Levitt's emotions right in
    front of us, and he is an earnest caricature of our most dramatic selves. (500) Days of Summer gets how I feel about this 
    topic.</p>
  <p><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> movies work well, I think, because of the performances. We know Peter Parker always had
    a crush on Gwen Stacy, and Gwen Stacy is intrigued by his earnestness. I think the relationship works well because of 
    the sheer talent of the acting. It's hard for actors to act in love, and it helps immensely that Garfield and Stone were
    dating in real life, so, in a way, we were seeing actual passion. It also works, I think, because we know from the 
    comics that the relationship is doomed, and for once we are seeing life not being cruel to Peter Parker. The trouble is,
    even though the actors are very talented, I'm not convinced the relationship would work if they were unattractive. In
    my opinion, a good way to test if we care about a relationship because of the characters, is ask 'would I still care
    about the relationship with unattractive actors?'</p>
  <p><i>Roman Holiday</i> is perhaps the best example for how to do a relationship well. We know Audrey Hepburn is attracted
    to Gregory Peck's free lifestyle, or just a lifestyle that isn't stuffed with stuffiness. We know Gregory Peck is 
    attracted to the opportunity he sees in showing Hepburn a good time. As they have fun in romantic Rome, they start to
    realize that each person is really quite fun, and they enjoy each other's company. Peck feels bad for Hepburn, and wants
    to give her the best holiday possible, because she needs and deserves it. Hepburn senses this compassion, and finds 
    wonder in how someone could care so much about someone else, and is touched, as no one has shown an ounce of this to her
    before. At this point we get the romance
    (around 4/5 of the way through the movie) and it feels completely justified. Furthermore, the actors are attractive in
    ways conducive to their story: Hepburn is small and thin, with innocence and naivety, and Peck is strong and weathered.
    Lastly, both actors are really good as actors. People define love as caring for someone else more than oneself, and this
    is perhaps the only movie that I've seen and felt that this is true.</p>
  <p>The trend here is that I don't hate romance in movies on principle; it's just that romance is so rarely done in a way
    to make the audience care. It is most often confused with lust, or, even more trite, repressed lust, and as a result
    doesn't hold any emotional weight. They think that throwing attractive characters at each other is convincing enough,
    but this plays more to an audience's libido than an examination of a true relationship. In Roger Ebert's words,
    "...two good-looking kids who want each other so much because they want each other so much."</p>
