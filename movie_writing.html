  <h2>Huh. The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is on Alec's list</h2>
  
  <p>This is the only movie on my list that I don't think is objectively as good as the others. Many people have problems with
    it, and even a few I respect. One of the main criticisms is that Andrew Garfield doesn't make a good spider-man. Tobey Maguire
    was way more awkward and nerdy than skateboard-riding prettyboy. There is the classic argument that Garfield played the 
    wisecracking webslinger better, which I shan't develop on. I also might add that I found the skateboarding of Garfield an
    interesting twist on Peter Parker. If you remain unconvinced that I genuinely thought this and am just making excuses as to why
    I must defend Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Marc Webb, three of my favorite actors/directors, I sympathize. However, this 
    was my first Webb movie, and this movie <i>made</i> Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone two of my favorite actors. Furthermore, I
    am loyal first and foremost to the spider-man comics. I used to read them every Sunday, and I pored over the spider-man 
    encyclopedia countless times as a child. Another argument against this movie
    is that the Lizard is a lame villain. Sure, it's a bit lackluster, but the focus is on spider-man; it's why the villain shows up
    so late in the movie. These two points lead me to why I enjoy the movie so damn much.</p>

  <h2>Why I didn't like Sal&ograve;, or the 120 Days of Sodom (how to do disturbing well)</h2>
  
  <p>It's not because I was offended by the disturbing imagery. I watched the infamous Sal&ograve;, or the 120 Days of Sodom
    (1975) last night, and while I didn't hate the movie, as the screen went black I felt completely empty; I didn't get
    anything out of it. What I liked was the artfulness of the shots, in an Anderson-esque composition, as well as the dancing
    while the prostitutes told their stories. It didn't feel like a geek show, that Pasolini was trying to pull a fast one on
    me. That's about it.</p>
  <p>I'm probably in the minority here. Michael Haneke and Gaspar No&eacute; both adore the movie, and it's in the Criterion
    Collection, which has movies that I usually like. I have read online that it is a statement about fascism and society. I'll
    tackle this case first.</p>
  <p>What exactly is the statement about fascism here? That evil men use fascism to commit unspeakable atrocities toward innocent
    people? This is not a groundbreaking artistic statement. That this is not a groundbreaking artistic statement is not the reason
    it was bad, but here a filmmaker has a choice: either explore the effect this has on characters or include more symbolism.
    Pasolini does neither. There is no attempt at characterization. I was just watching people as stiff as chess pieces
    doing horrible things. There was no character development in the torturers or the tortured. One doesn't have to do this,
    but they must find some other way to engage the audience. Pasolini didn't, or, if he did, he didn't do it for me. It felt
    like I was just watching things happen onscreen; a two-dimensional experience of moving bodies. Maybe this stoicism is an 
    artistic statement; that the filmmaker doesn't care about what's happening to these poor men and women, showing the cold
    passiveness involved with this sort of treachery. In this case, the way to make it work is to show the victims' emotions more,
    because it makes the lack of caring from the filmmaker evident. This didn't happen. What about including more symbolism?
    As far as I know, the movie doesn't  make any conclusions. It doesn't teach me anything. If this is a metaphor for
    fascism, the message is restricted to "evil men use fascism to molest the public." I read somewhere that Pasolini claimed that
    the coprophagia was a metaphor for junk food culture. If this is true, the metaphor was lousily executed. This also begs the
    question of why Pasolini was using such extreme a metaphor? If one uses an extreme metaphor, it should be because they are
    wildly passionate about the material, but that wasn't the vibe I was getting watching this movie. In this case, the cold
    way in which he shot things works against the claim. If Sal&ograve; is a metaphor for fascism, it is a blunt one.</p>
  <p>If this isn't supposed to be a metaphor at all for fascism, I think the movie is considerably more sophisticated as a pure
    portrait of hell. I've seen portraits of hell that, in my opinion, are much better and more engaging, but this is a fine spin
    on it. If this is the case, I think it's more true to Marqui de Sade's original work; it's a chronicle of human debauchery
    that one should to visit if one wants to visit. If this is the case, however, the cold, dispassionate way in which it is shot
    works against it was well. Would it not be more hellish if the filmmaker showed joy with this material? Instead, the austerity
    diffuses the hellishness, and leaves me, again, feeling like I wasted my time with this movie.</p>
  <p>In short, I think if Pasolini tried to use this as symbolism, it is as sophisticated as any high schooler's short story. There
    are no conclusions or clever ways in which the metaphor is used. If not, it is a lackluster exercise in horrible images. I think
    there are many more disturbing movies that use it's disturbing-ness, rather than have it be the entire movie. I'm pretty sure
    this is the most disturbing movie I've seen, but now I'll compare it to disturbing movies that I think are better.<p>
  <p>Last House on the Left (1972) is better because it is up front about how it's trying to be disturbing; the filmmakers are
    honest about how they want to disturb and disgust. They show a geek show, but want you to know they want a geek show, because
    they are frustrated about Vietnam. One can feel the passion in their metaphor, and I left the movie feeling like I just had an
    experience. I felt no passion in Pasolini's movie, and left the movie accordingly.</p>
  <p>That's the thing about most respectable disturbing movies. There's often passion. What about disturbing movies devoid of
    passion?</p>
  <p>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) appears like it might be a geek show, but the artistry of the cinematography, set design,
    writing, and especially acting hint to use that we clearly are dealing this an artist. Furthermore, the awfulness in that movie
    feels like it is just a consequence of the plot. Everything in that movie is logical, and it is more based in fact than
    Sal&ograve;. Furthermore, it is comedic, a satire on the American family in the seventies. The upheaval of the sixties and the
    phenomenon of serial killers during this era is reflected in this movie much more than the fascism of Italy is reflected in
    Sal&ograve;.</p>
  <p>Another movie without passion is Ichi the Killer (2001). Here the movie is psychotically enthralled with how crazy it is. It
    completely surrenders itself to its mayhem and madness, and occupies a piece of filmspace where a viewer goes to if they want to
    lose their mind and have fun doing it. It makes no attempt to make moral statements; it tries actively to illustrate how fun it
    is to be morally reprehensible, if you're crazy.</p>
  <p>However, all of these movies deal with their disturbing-ness in their own unique way. Sal&ograve; certainly shouldn't lose 
    points for going in a different direction than these movies. However, there is another disturbing movie about evil men using 
    fascism to torment and control innocent children: Battle Royale (2000). Here I argue that this movie is, in many ways, a few
    orders of magnitude better than Sal&ograve;. First of all, Battle Royale is similarly blunt in its metaphor. It doesn't contain
    more symbolism than Sal&ograve;. However, it is infinitely more engaging. The movie is about being an adolescent in a world where
    the adults are insane and evil. More broadly, it is about the common person in a world where the rulers are insane and evil. Because
    of this theme,
    Battle Royale develops heavily on the perpetrator, Kitano, and the victims. In most of the scenes with the victims, the shots are
    cold and austere; most of the children getting slaughtered have no background to us. However, the children are allowed to show
    their emotions. They kick, scream, run, and cry, while the camera looks passively onward. This gets across the message of adults'
    stoicism, but is all the more effective when this emotion is shown. Furthermore, the extreme violence has a purpose. Adolescence
    is an intense time, and the backdrop of gruesome violence serves to make those intense aspects of being an adolescent all the more
    intense. The violence is extreme <i>because it allows for the purest examination</i> of what it means to be an adolescent being
    taken advantage of by those in power. Battle Royale also engages with protagonists, albeit in a minimalist way. By doing this, it
    forces us to feel the frustration they feel, and the frustration the director feels, leading me to my next point. The violence in 
    Battle Royale is more truthful than in Sal&ograve;. Kinji Fukusaku wanted to direct Battle Royale because he essentially lived
    through Battle Royale. Pasolini didn't live through anything like Sal&ograve;. This is not to say that he shouldn't have directed
    it, but it does explain why the message, if it exists, is really weak. Both movies give cold, hellish depictions of extreme 
    violence committed by evil men of power against innocent adolescents. But Battle Royale finds a way to be much more engaging, 
    is reflective of the powerless human's condition, is a warning and a fable. It is disturbing because being disturbing is the most
    effective and passionate way to tell the story. In Sal&ograve;, the disturbing-ness is just there, as thematically deep as an 
    Aristocrats Joke. It isn't offensive, I'll give it that, but it just sits there.
    To all the respectable filmmakers who love Sal&ograve;, I ask: Why, and have you seen Battle Royale?</p>
  <p><b>Update:</b> Upon further reading, it appears Pasolini wanted to adapt Marquis de Sade's work, and then decided to apply it to
    fascist Italy. This emphasizes my point: Pasolini wanted to adapt the content and subsequently ascribed meaning (not well-executed,
    as it felt like exactly that), whereas Fukusaku knew he could use Battle Royale for a message we wanted to give us.</p>
