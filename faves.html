  <h1>Alec Lau's Top 11 Favorite Movies of All Time</h1>
  
  <p>Here are my top 11 favorite movies of all time. Talk about obsession. These 11 (and Roman Holiday) are more like
  posession. The reason I nixed Roman Holiday is because there are more parts in it that I find tiresome than in any
    of these (the number of tiresome parts is 1 - Greg Peck first meets with his manager). Also, 11 is already a stretch
  from everyone's favorite "top" number. 11 is better. It is more aesthetic, it is prime, it symbolizes going one step
  beyond, it allows me to omit one less amazing masterpiece so good that, when considering this work, I am thankful to
  be alive just for the experience of these movies. When it came to making this list, all of these movies are no-brainers.
    "Really, Alec? Superbad possessed you? And what about The Amazing
    Spider-Man? Tobey Maguire blah blah blah." Here's an idea. Watch those movies with an eye out for emotion and creativity.
    Some of these movies are honestly on here because of the significance it played at a certain point in my life. In that
    sense, making them a favorite, while a no-brainer, is subjective, like a lot of things on these movie pages.
  The problem was, a few movies extra were also no brainers. Thus, I applied logic in place of my feelings (something I
    rarely do for movies) and decided which movies best deserve their place amongst this unfairly exclusive list.</p>
