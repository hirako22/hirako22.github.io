  <h1>Alec Lau's Top 12 Favorite Movies of All Time</h1>
  
  <p>Here are my top 12 favorite movies of all time. (in order?) Talk about obsession. These 12 are instead
     more like
  posession. When seeing these movies for the [Graham's Number]th time, each time I am thankful that I am alive just to
    experience said movie, and could not imagine going through life without it.</p><p>
    The reason I picked 12 is that 12 is a good number. It is divisible by a lot, making an even grid of images for most
  tab dimensions, it is the number of months in a year, it allows me to omit one less amazing masterpiece, etc.
  When it came to making this list, all of these movies are no-brainers.
    "Really, Alec? Superbad possessed you? And what about The Amazing
    Spider-Man? Tobey Maguire blah blah blah." Here's an idea. Watch those movies with an eye out for emotion and creativity.
    Some of these movies are honestly on here because of the significance it played at a certain point in my life. In that
    sense, making them a favorite, while a no-brainer, is subjective, like a lot of things on these movie pages.
  The problem was, a few movies extra were also no brainers. Thus, I applied logic in place of my feelings (something I
    rarely do for movies) and decided which movies best deserve their place amongst this unfairly exclusive list.</p>
